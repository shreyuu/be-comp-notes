## Unit I: Introduction to Machine Learning

### 1.1 Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. It relies on patterns and inference from data.
- **Comparison of ML with Traditional Programming:**
  - In **traditional programming**, rules and logic are explicitly coded by developers to solve a problem.
  - In **ML**, the algorithm learns from data. Instead of coding rules manually, the model is trained on a dataset and it "learns" to make predictions or decisions based on this data.
- **ML vs AI vs Data Science:**
  - **AI** encompasses the broader field of creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
  - **ML** is a subset of AI, emphasizing algorithms and statistical models that enable a machine to improve its performance on a task over time without being explicitly programmed.
  - **Data Science** is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, often leveraging ML.

### 1.2 Types of Learning
- **Supervised Learning:**
  - The model is trained on labeled data, where the input data is paired with the correct output.
  - Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks.
  - **Examples:** Email spam detection, fraud detection, image recognition.
- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - The model is trained on unlabeled data, and it attempts to infer the natural structure present within a set of data.
  - Common algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Association Rules.
  - **Examples:** Market basket analysis, customer segmentation, anomaly detection.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning:**
  - A middle ground between supervised and unsupervised learning. The model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
  - **Examples:** Web page classification, protein sequence classification.
- **Reinforcement Learning:**
  - An agent learns by interacting with its environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.
  - Common algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), Policy Gradients.
  - **Examples:** Robotics, game playing, resource management.

### 1.3 Models of Machine Learning
- **Geometric Models:** Models that use geometric representations, such as lines, planes, and hyperplanes. For example, Linear Regression and Support Vector Machines.
- **Probabilistic Models:** Models based on probability theory, which make predictions based on the likelihood of outcomes. Examples include Naive Bayes and Hidden Markov Models.
- **Logical Models:** Models based on logical rules, often represented as decision trees or rule-based systems. For example, Decision Trees and Rule-Based Classifiers.
- **Grouping and Grading Models:** Models used for clustering or ranking tasks. Clustering algorithms like K-Means and ranking models like RankNet are examples.
- **Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Models:**
  - **Parametric Models** have a fixed number of parameters (e.g., Linear Regression).
  - **Non-Parametric Models** can grow in complexity with the size of the training dataset (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees).

### 1.4 Important Elements of Machine Learning
- **Data Formats:** Understanding different data types and formats (structured, unstructured, semi-structured) is crucial as ML algorithms operate differently based on input data formats.
- **Learnability:** Refers to the capacity of a model to learn from data and generalize to new, unseen data. Concepts like PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning and VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension help understand the theoretical limits of learnability.
- **Statistical Learning Approaches:** These approaches involve using statistical models to infer the structure in data, which includes techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, and Bayesian inference.

### Exemplar Case Study:
**Uber Sales Increase:**
- **Scenario:** A task to increase sales is given, requiring an understanding of client requirements and the application of ML models to analyze customer data, predict trends, and provide actionable insights.

## Unit II: Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Concept of Feature Engineering
- **Feature Engineering** is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data that make machine learning algorithms work better.
- **Importance:** Well-engineered features can significantly improve the performance of ML models by providing relevant inputs that the algorithms can learn from effectively.

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing Techniques
- **Normalization and Scaling:** Adjusting the range of data to bring all values into a common scale without distorting differences in ranges of values. 
  - **Normalization** typically rescales the data to a range of [0,1] or [-1,1].
  - **Scaling (Standardization):** Adjusts the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
- **Managing Missing Values:**
  - **Deletion Methods:** Removing instances with missing data, which can lead to loss of information.
  - **Imputation Methods:** Filling in missing data with substituted values, such as mean, median, mode, or using more sophisticated techniques like k-Nearest Neighbors imputation.
  
### 2.3 Dimensionality Reduction
- **Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of input variables in a dataset to improve the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning algorithms.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A technique that reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible by transforming data to a new coordinate system.
- **Feature Extraction Techniques:**
  - **Kernel PCA:** An extension of PCA that uses kernel methods to allow for non-linear dimensionality reduction.
  - **Local Binary Pattern (LBP):** A method used for texture classification and feature extraction in image processing.

### 2.4 Feature Selection Techniques
- **Introduction to Feature Selection:** The process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction.
- **Sequential Forward Selection (SFS):** Starts with an empty feature set and adds features that improve model performance one by one.
- **Sequential Backward Selection (SBS):** Starts with all features and removes the least significant feature at each step.
  
### 2.5 Statistical Feature Engineering
- **Count-Based Features:** Features based on the count of certain data points (e.g., the number of times a word appears in a document).
- **Length-Based Features:** Features based on the length of data points (e.g., the length of a sentence).
- **Mean, Median, Mode Features:** Features derived from basic statistical measures applied to data points.

### 2.6 Advanced Techniques
- **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS):** A technique used to visualize the level of similarity of individual cases of a dataset.
- **Matrix Factorization Techniques:** Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) used for dimensionality reduction in collaborative filtering and recommendation systems.

### Exemplar Case Study:
**Marketing Strategy Effectiveness:**
- **Scenario:** As a data scientist, analyze the client's data from past marketing campaigns to identify which strategies are most effective in increasing sales. Utilize data preprocessing, feature selection, and engineering techniques to improve the predictive performance of the models used.

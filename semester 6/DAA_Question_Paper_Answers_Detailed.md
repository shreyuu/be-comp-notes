## Q1) a) Why is the correctness of the algorithm important? Define loop invariant property and prove the correctness of finding the summation of n numbers using loop invariant property. [8 marks]

### Importance of Algorithm Correctness

Correctness is a fundamental property of any algorithm. It ensures that the algorithm produces the expected output for every possible valid input. An algorithm that is not correct could lead to incorrect results, system crashes, or even security vulnerabilities. For example, an incorrect sorting algorithm might fail to sort the data properly, leading to erroneous data processing in critical applications such as financial transactions or medical diagnoses. Ensuring correctness is essential for building reliable and robust software systems.

### Loop Invariant Property

A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of a loop. It is a powerful tool used in proving the correctness of algorithms, especially those involving loops. A loop invariant helps demonstrate that an algorithm maintains certain properties throughout its execution.

**Example: Proving the Correctness of Summation of n Numbers**

Consider the problem of summing the first `n` natural numbers using a simple loop. We want to prove that the algorithm correctly computes the sum using a loop invariant.

```python
def sum_n_numbers(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total += i
    return total
```

**Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the loop, `total` contains the sum of the first `i-1` numbers.

1. **Initialization**: Before the first iteration, `i = 1` and `total = 0`. The loop invariant holds because the sum of zero numbers is zero.
2. **Maintenance**: If the loop invariant holds before an iteration, adding `i` to `total` updates `total` to the sum of the first `i` numbers. Thus, the invariant holds after each iteration.
3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `i = n+1`. At this point, `total` contains the sum of all `n` numbers, proving the algorithm is correct.

By maintaining the loop invariant, we ensure that the algorithm correctly computes the desired sum.

## Q1) b) What is an iterative algorithm? Explain iterative algorithm design issues using examples. [7 marks]

### Iterative Algorithm

An iterative algorithm is a method that repeatedly executes a block of code (loop) until a certain condition is met. Unlike recursive algorithms, which solve problems by calling themselves with a reduced problem size, iterative algorithms use constructs like `for`, `while`, or `do-while` loops to perform repetitive tasks.

### Design Issues in Iterative Algorithms

1. **Initialization**: Properly initializing variables before the loop starts is critical. Incorrect initialization can lead to wrong results or infinite loops.
   - **Example**: In the factorial computation using iteration, initializing the result to 1 is essential.

2. **Termination Condition**: Ensuring that the loop terminates under all circumstances is necessary to avoid infinite loops.
   - **Example**: A `while` loop that runs as long as a counter is less than a given number must increment the counter to ensure termination.

3. **Correctness and Maintenance of Invariants**: Ensuring that the algorithm maintains certain properties (invariants) throughout its execution.
   - **Example**: In an iterative binary search, maintaining the invariant that the target is within the current search bounds is crucial.

4. **Efficiency**: Iterative algorithms should be designed to minimize computational complexity and avoid unnecessary calculations.
   - **Example**: In bubble sort, recognizing that the largest element is at the correct position after each pass can reduce the number of comparisons in subsequent passes.

By addressing these design issues, we ensure that iterative algorithms are efficient, correct, and robust.

## Q2) a) How to prove that an algorithm is correct? How to prove the correctness of an algorithm using a counterexample? Give a suitable example. [7 marks]

### Proving Algorithm Correctness

To prove an algorithm is correct, we must show that for all valid inputs, the algorithm produces the correct output and terminates.

- **Formal Proof Methods**:
  1. **Induction**: Proving the base case and inductive step.
  2. **Loop Invariant**: Demonstrating that a condition holds true before and after each loop iteration.
  3. **Contradiction**: Assuming the opposite of the desired conclusion and showing it leads to a contradiction.

### Proving Incorrectness Using a Counterexample

A counterexample shows a specific input for which the algorithm fails, proving it is incorrect.

**Example**: Suppose we have an algorithm that finds the maximum value in an array by comparing only even-indexed elements.

```python
def find_max_even_index(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for i in range(0, len(arr), 2):
        if arr[i] > max_val:
            max_val = arr[i]
    return max_val
```

**Counterexample**:
Consider the array `arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]`. The correct maximum is `4`, but this algorithm returns `3`, proving the algorithm is incorrect because it does not consider odd-indexed elements.

Using counterexamples helps identify flaws in algorithms and refine them for correctness.

## Q2) b) Write a short note on any 4 problem-solving strategies. [8 marks]

### Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - This strategy involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem recursively, and combining the solutions to solve the original problem.
   - **Example**: Merge Sort divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges the sorted halves.

2. **Greedy Algorithms**:
   - A greedy algorithm builds a solution step-by-step, choosing the option that offers the most immediate benefit.
   - **Example**: Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm greedily selects the nearest unvisited vertex to determine the shortest path in a weighted graph.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
   - **Example**: The Fibonacci sequence can be efficiently computed by storing the results of previous computations in a table.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - This strategy involves exploring all potential solutions and backtracking when a potential solution violates constraints.
   - **Example**: The N-Queens problem places queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other, and backtracks whenever a conflict arises.

By understanding these strategies, we can choose the most appropriate approach to solve different types of problems efficiently.

## Q3) a) What is Best, Average, and Worst-case Analysis of Algorithms? Analyze the following algorithm for Best, Average, and Worst cases. [8 marks]

### Algorithm Analysis

Analyzing an algorithm involves determining its efficiency in terms of time and space complexity. The analysis is often done for three cases:

1. **Best Case**: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of steps. This often represents an ideal situation.
   - **Example**: For a linear search, the best case occurs when the target element is at the first position (O(1)).

2. **Average Case**: The expected number of steps for a random input. This represents a typical scenario.
   - **Example**: For linear search, the average case involves searching through half of the elements (O(n/2)).

3. **Worst Case**: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of steps. This is used to define the upper bound of the algorithm’s performance.
   - **Example**: For a linear search, the worst case occurs when the target element is at the last position or not present (O(n)).

**Algorithm**: Insertion Sort
```python
void sort(int a[], int n) {
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        j = i - 1;
        key = a[i];
        while (j >= 0 && a[j] > key) {
            a[j + 1] = a[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        a[j + 1] = key;
    }
}
```

**Analysis**:
- **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
- **Average Case**: O(n^2) when the array elements are in random order.
- **Worst Case**: O(n^2) when the array is in reverse order.

Understanding these cases helps in determining the efficiency and scalability of the algorithm.

## Q3) b) Explain P, NP, NP-Hard, and NP-Complete problems with examples. Explain the 3-SAT problem using an example. Why is SAT so important in theoretical computer science? [7 marks]

### Complexity Classes

1. **P (Polynomial Time)**:
   - Problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine.
   - **Example**: Sorting algorithms like Merge Sort.

2. **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)**:
   - Problems for which a given solution can be verified in polynomial time.
   - **Example**: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).

3. **NP-Hard**:
   - As hard as the hardest problems in NP; a problem X is NP-Hard if every problem in NP can be reduced to X in polynomial time.
   - **Example**: The traveling salesman problem (TSP).

4. **NP-Complete**:
   - Problems that are both in NP and NP-Hard. They are the most challenging problems within NP.
   - **Example**: 3-SAT (3-Satisfiability).

### 3-SAT Problem

The 3-SAT problem asks if there exists a truth assignment to variables that satisfies a Boolean formula composed of clauses with exactly three literals.

**Example**:
Consider the formula `(A ∨ ¬B ∨ C) ∧ (¬A ∨ B ∨ ¬C) ∧ (A ∨ B ∨ ¬C)`. A truth assignment such as `A = True, B = True, C = False` satisfies all clauses.

### Importance of SAT in Theoretical Computer Science

SAT is important because it was the first problem proven to be NP-Complete, and many other problems in NP can be reduced to SAT. Understanding the complexity of SAT helps in understanding the entire NP class and the famous P vs NP problem, one of the biggest unsolved questions in computer science.

## Q4) a) What is an algorithm design technique? What are the algorithm design techniques? Explain in brief each of them with examples. [8 marks]

### Algorithm Design Techniques

An algorithm design technique is a general approach or method for creating algorithms to solve problems. Here are some of the primary design techniques:

1. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines their solutions.
   - **Example**: Merge Sort, which divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Example**: The Fibonacci sequence can be calculated efficiently using dynamic programming by storing previously computed results.

3. **Greedy Algorithms**:
   - Makes a sequence of choices that are locally optimal with the hope of finding a global optimum.
   - **Example**: Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for finding a minimum spanning tree.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - Tries all possibilities recursively and backtracks upon reaching a dead-end.
   - **Example**: Solving a Sudoku puzzle by trying all numbers and backtracking when a contradiction occurs.

5. **Branch and Bound**:
   - Similar to backtracking but with a bounding function to eliminate subproblems that do not lead to a better solution.
   - **Example**: Solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) more efficiently by bounding the search space.

Understanding these techniques helps in selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem and in developing efficient solutions.

## Q4) b) What are the characteristics of a good algorithm? How do you measure the complexity of an algorithm? [7 marks]

### Characteristics of a Good Algorithm

1. **Correctness**: The algorithm should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
2. **Efficiency**: The algorithm should make optimal use of resources such as time and space.
3. **Clarity**: The algorithm should be easy to understand and implement.
4. **Finiteness**: The algorithm should terminate after a finite number of steps.
5. **Robustness**: The algorithm should handle all possible inputs gracefully, including edge cases.

### Measuring Complexity

**Complexity** refers to the amount of computational resources (time and space) an algorithm requires as a function of the input size.

1. **Time Complexity**: Measured by counting the number of basic operations performed relative to the input size. Expressed using Big O notation, e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2).
2. **Space Complexity**: Measured by the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution relative to the input size.

By analyzing complexity, we can predict the algorithm's performance and scalability, which helps in making informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a specific problem.

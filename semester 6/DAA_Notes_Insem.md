### **Unit I: Algorithms and Problem Solving**

#### **1.1 Introduction to Algorithms**
- **Definition**: An algorithm is a finite set of well-defined instructions to solve a specific problem or perform a computation.
- **Role of Algorithms in Computing**:
  - **Efficiency**: Algorithms provide a systematic method for solving problems efficiently in terms of time and space.
  - **Technology Evolution**: Algorithms drive technological advancements by optimizing computations and processing data more effectively.
  - **Algorithm Design**: Critical for software development, AI, data processing, etc.

#### **1.2 Evolution of Algorithms**
- **Historical Context**:
  - Algorithms have evolved from simple arithmetic procedures to complex problem-solving techniques.
  - The development of more sophisticated algorithms has been essential for handling large datasets and complex problems.

#### **1.3 Need for Correctness of Algorithms**
- **Correctness**: An algorithm is correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.
- **Importance**:
  - Ensures that algorithms produce expected and reliable results.
  - Prevents errors and unintended behaviors in software and systems.
- **Confirming Correctness**: Techniques such as **loop invariants**, **inductive proofs**, and **testing** are used to ensure algorithms are correct.

#### **1.4 Iterative Algorithm Design**
- **Iterative Algorithms**: Algorithms that use loops (e.g., `for`, `while`) to repeat certain operations until a condition is met.
- **Design Issues**:
  - **Termination**: The loop must eventually terminate. Improper conditions can cause infinite loops.
  - **Initialization**: Proper initial values are crucial to avoid incorrect results or behavior.
  - **Increment/Decrement**: Loop variables should change in such a way that the termination condition is met.
  - **Efficiency**: Reducing the number of iterations or optimizing the loop body improves performance.

#### **1.5 Problem Solving Principles**
- **Classification of Problems**:
  - **Easy/Tractable Problems**: Problems solvable in polynomial time (P-class).
  - **Hard/Intractable Problems**: Problems not solvable in polynomial time (NP, NP-complete, NP-hard).
- **Problem Solving Strategies**:
  - **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks a problem into subproblems, solves them independently, and combines results.
  - **Greedy Method**: Makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
  - **Dynamic Programming**: Solves complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems and storing solutions to avoid redundant work.
  - **Backtracking**: Explores all possibilities and backtracks when a solution is not found.

#### **1.6 Example: Towers of Hanoi**
- **Problem Description**: Moving a stack of disks from one rod to another, with the constraint of only moving one disk at a time and never placing a larger disk on a smaller one.
- **Algorithm**:
  - Move `n-1` disks from source to auxiliary rod.
  - Move the `nth` disk from source to destination rod.
  - Move `n-1` disks from auxiliary to destination rod.

### **Unit II: Analysis of Algorithms and Complexity Theory**

#### **2.1 Introduction to Algorithm Analysis**
- **Purpose**: To evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time (how fast it runs) and space (how much memory it uses).
- **Types of Analysis**:
  - **Worst Case**: Maximum time or space required for any input of size `n`.
  - **Best Case**: Minimum time or space required for any input of size `n`.
  - **Average Case**: Expected time or space required for a "typical" input of size `n`.

#### **2.2 Asymptotic Notations**
- **Big-O Notation (O)**: Describes the upper bound of the running time. Represents the worst-case scenario.
  - Example: \(O(n^2)\) for a quadratic time complexity algorithm.
- **Big-Omega Notation (Ω)**: Describes the lower bound of the running time. Represents the best-case scenario.
  - Example: \(Ω(n)\) for linear time complexity.
- **Big-Theta Notation (Θ)**: Describes the tight bound of the running time. Represents both the upper and lower bounds.
  - Example: \(Θ(n \log n)\) for algorithms like Merge Sort.
- **Little-o Notation (o)**: Describes an upper bound that is not tight.
  - Example: \(o(n^2)\) is any function that grows slower than \(n^2\).
- **Little-omega Notation (ω)**: Describes a lower bound that is not tight.
  - Example: \(ω(n)\) is any function that grows faster than \(n\).

#### **2.3 Growth Rates and Complexity Classes**
- **Polynomial Time (P)**: Class of problems solvable in polynomial time (e.g., \(O(n^2), O(n^3)\)).
- **Non-Polynomial Time (NP)**: Class of problems verifiable in polynomial time but not necessarily solvable in polynomial time.
- **Deterministic Algorithms**: Always produce the same output for a given input in polynomial time.
- **Non-Deterministic Algorithms**: May have different outcomes for the same input; used in theoretical contexts to describe NP problems.

#### **2.4 NP, NP-Complete, and NP-Hard Problems**
- **NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial time)**: Problems verifiable in polynomial time.
- **NP-Complete**: Subset of NP problems that are as hard as any problem in NP. A problem is NP-complete if:
  - It is in NP.
  - Every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time.
- **NP-Hard**: Problems as hard as the hardest problems in NP. Not necessarily in NP themselves.
  
#### **2.5 Examples of NP-Complete Problems**
- **Vertex Cover**: Given a graph, find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex.
- **3-SAT Problem**: A special case of the Boolean satisfiability problem where each clause has exactly three literals. It is used to prove that many problems are NP-complete.
- **Hamiltonian Cycle**: Determining if a cycle exists that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.

#### **2.6 Algorithm Analysis Techniques**
- **Counting Dominant Operations**: Focus on the most frequent or time-consuming operations (e.g., comparisons in sorting).
- **Analyzing Recursive Algorithms**:
  - Use recurrence relations to describe the running time.
  - Solve recurrences to determine the time complexity.

#### **2.7 Example: Analyzing Insertion Sort**
- **Algorithm**:
  ```cpp
  void sort(int a[], int n) {
      int i, j, key;
      for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
          key = a[i];
          j = i - 1;
          while (j >= 0 && a[j] > key) {
              a[j + 1] = a[j];
              j = j - 1;
          }
          a[j + 1] = key;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Best Case**: \(O(n)\) (Already sorted array; single comparison per iteration).
- **Worst Case**: \(O(n^2)\) (Reversed sorted array; maximum comparisons and shifts).
- **Average Case**: \(O(n^2)\) (Half of the array is in sorted order on average).

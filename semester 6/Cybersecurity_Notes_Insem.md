- **Nature and Scope of Cyber Crime:** 
  - **Nature:** Cybercrime can be categorized into two types:
    - Crimes that target computers directly (e.g., hacking, virus dissemination).
    - Crimes facilitated by computers (e.g., cyberstalking, identity theft).
  - **Scope:** Cybercrime's scope is global, as it transcends physical borders. It can affect individuals, corporations, and governments, leading to significant financial, reputational, and operational damages.

**1.2 Types of Cyber Crime**
- **Crime Against Individuals:**
  - **Cyberstalking:** Persistent harassment or threats through online platforms.
  - **Identity Theft:** Unauthorized use of someoneâ€™s personal information.
  - **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information.
- **Crime Against Property:**
  - **Hacking:** Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks.
  - **Cyber Vandalism:** Deliberate damage to or alteration of data.
  - **Intellectual Property Theft:** Stealing copyrighted material or trade secrets.
- **Cyber Extortion:** Using threats to demand money or information from individuals or organizations.
- **Drug Trafficking:** Using the dark web for illegal drug distribution.
- **Cyber Terrorism:** Disrupting or damaging information systems for political or ideological motives.

**1.3 Need for Information Security**
- **Information Security:** Refers to the processes and methodologies designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
- **Importance:**
  - Protects data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
  - Ensures privacy and compliance with regulations.
  - Protects against cyber threats that could lead to financial losses, legal liabilities, and reputational damage.

**1.4 Threats to Information Systems**
- **Malware:** Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojans).
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information through deceptive emails or websites.
- **Insider Threats:** Employees or contractors who misuse access to information for malicious purposes.
- **DDoS Attacks:** Overloading a system or network to make it unavailable to users.

**1.5 Information Assurance**
- **Information Assurance (IA):** The practice of managing information-related risks. It includes protecting data integrity, availability, authenticity, and confidentiality.
- **Key Components:**
  - **Risk Management:** Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to information assets.
  - **Security Controls:** Measures implemented to protect information (e.g., firewalls, encryption).
  - **Incident Response:** Procedures to handle security breaches or attacks.

**1.6 Cyber Security**
- **Cyber Security:** The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It involves technologies, processes, and controls that protect against unauthorized exploitation of systems and data.
- **Key Areas:**
  - **Application Security:** Securing software applications from external threats.
  - **Network Security:** Protecting the integrity of networking infrastructures.
  - **Endpoint Security:** Ensuring the security of devices connected to a network.

**1.7 Security Risk Analysis**
- **Security Risk Analysis:** The process of identifying and assessing security risks to information systems. It involves evaluating the potential impact of threats and the likelihood of their occurrence.
- **Steps Involved:**
  - **Risk Identification:** Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities.
  - **Risk Assessment:** Analyzing the impact and likelihood of each risk.
  - **Risk Mitigation:** Implementing measures to reduce or eliminate risks.

### **Unit 2: Cyber Crime Issues and Cyber Attacks**

**2.1 Unauthorized Access to Computers**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Refers to accessing a computer system without permission, typically with malicious intent.
- **Examples:** Hacking into a system, using stolen credentials, bypassing security mechanisms.

**2.2 Computer Intrusions**
- **Computer Intrusions:** Involves breaching computer systems to steal or manipulate data. It is often the first step in more complex cyberattacks.
- **Types of Intrusions:**
  - **Remote Access Trojans (RATs):** Malware that provides attackers with control over infected computers.
  - **Backdoors:** Secret methods of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a system.

**2.3 Viruses and Malicious Code**
- **Viruses:** Malicious software that attaches itself to legitimate files and spreads when those files are shared.
- **Malicious Code:** Includes a variety of threats such as viruses, worms, and Trojans that can cause damage to systems or data.

**2.4 Internet Hacking and Cracking**
- **Hacking:** The act of exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.
- **Cracking:** Breaking into systems, typically to bypass protections or steal data.

**2.5 Software Piracy**
- **Software Piracy:** The illegal copying, distribution, or use of software. It includes both unauthorized use of licensed software and distribution of counterfeit copies.

**2.6 Intellectual Property**
- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Legal rights to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images.
- **Cyber Crime and IP:** Includes crimes such as software piracy, copyright infringement, and theft of trade secrets.

**2.7 Mail Bombs**
- **Mail Bombs:** The act of sending large volumes of emails to a single address to flood a mailbox and disrupt services.

**2.8 Exploitation, Stalking, and Obscenity in Internet**
- **Exploitation:** Refers to using the internet to exploit individuals, particularly minors, through coercion or manipulation.
- **Cyber Stalking:** The use of the internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual.
- **Obscenity:** Refers to the distribution of offensive or illegal material through the internet, such as child pornography.

**2.9 Cybercrime Prevention Methods**
- **Education and Awareness:** Training users to recognize and avoid cyber threats.
- **Security Policies:** Implementing policies that define how to protect information and respond to incidents.
- **Technical Measures:** Using firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption to protect against attacks.

**2.10 Application Security**
- **Database Security:** Measures to protect databases from threats like SQL injection.
- **E-mail Security:** Techniques to protect email communication from threats such as phishing and spam.
- **Internet Security:** Ensuring the security of internet-based applications and services.

**2.11 Data Security Considerations**
- **Backups:** Regularly creating copies of data to prevent loss in case of a breach.
- **Archival Storage:** Securely storing data that is no longer actively used but must be retained for compliance or other reasons.
- **Disposal of Data:** Ensuring that data is completely destroyed when it is no longer needed to prevent unauthorized access.

**2.12 Security Technology**
- **Firewalls:** Systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks):** Secure tunnels that encrypt data as it travels across the internet, protecting it from interception.

**2.13 Hardware Protection Mechanisms**
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM):** A hardware-based security feature that provides cryptographic functions.
- **Secure Boot:** A feature that ensures a computer boots using only software that is trusted by the manufacturer.

**2.14 OS Security**
- **Operating System Security:** Measures implemented at the OS level to protect against threats, including regular updates, access control, and user authentication.

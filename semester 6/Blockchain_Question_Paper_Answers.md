### **Question Paper 1:**

#### **Question 1 (Q1)**

**a) List and explain the advantages of ECC. [5 Marks]**

**Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Advantages:**

1. **Smaller Key Size for Equivalent Security:**
   - ECC offers the same level of security as other public-key cryptography methods (like RSA) but with much smaller key sizes. For instance, a 256-bit key in ECC provides equivalent security to a 3072-bit key in RSA. This results in faster computations and reduced storage requirements.

2. **Lower Computational Power Requirements:**
   - Due to its smaller key size, ECC requires less computational power, making it ideal for devices with limited processing capabilities, such as mobile phones and IoT devices.

3. **Faster Key Generation and Encryption/Decryption:**
   - ECC-based systems can generate keys and perform encryption and decryption faster than RSA, enhancing the overall efficiency of cryptographic operations.

4. **Reduced Bandwidth Usage:**
   - The smaller key sizes also mean that less data is transmitted during secure communications, reducing bandwidth usage and enhancing communication speeds.

5. **Enhanced Security for Digital Signatures:**
   - ECC provides robust security for digital signatures, which are essential for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of messages and transactions in blockchain networks.

**b) Differentiate between asymmetric and symmetric key cryptography. [5 Marks]**

|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                  | Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.    | Uses a pair of keys – public key for encryption and private key for decryption. |
| **Speed**                       | Faster encryption and decryption.                        | Slower due to more complex mathematical computations.    |

**c) Discuss the properties of hash functions. [5 Marks]**

**Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions:**

1. **Deterministic:** The same input always produces the same output. This is crucial for data verification purposes.
2. **Fast Computation:** Hash functions should produce output quickly, even for large datasets.
3. **Pre-Image Resistance:** Given a hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input.
4. **Small Changes Affect Output:** Even a small change in the input (like flipping a single bit) should result in a significantly different hash value (Avalanche Effect).

#### **Question 2 (Q2)**

**a) List and discuss the benefits of the Merkle tree. [5 Marks]**

**Benefits of Merkle Trees in Blockchain:**

1. **Efficient Verification of Data Integrity:**
   - Merkle trees allow users to verify the integrity and consistency of large datasets efficiently without needing to access the entire dataset. This is particularly useful in blockchain networks where data is stored across distributed nodes.

2. **Reduced Data Storage:**
   - Only the root hash (Merkle root) needs to be stored securely, while individual transactions can be pruned, saving storage space.

3. **Facilitates Light Clients:**
   - Light clients, or SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) clients, use Merkle proofs to verify transactions without downloading the entire blockchain. This makes blockchain more accessible to devices with limited resources.

4. **Tamper Evidence:**
   - Any tampering with the data (e.g., a single transaction) will result in a completely different Merkle root, making unauthorized changes easily detectable.

5. **Enhanced Security:**
   - Merkle trees provide an additional layer of security for blockchain transactions, ensuring data integrity and preventing fraud.

**b) Explain DSA key generation and verification. [5 Marks]**

**Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA):**

1. **Key Generation:**
   - Choose a prime number `q` and a prime number `p` such that `p-1` is a multiple of `q`.
   - Select a generator `g` such that \( g^q \mod p = 1 \) and \( 1 < g < p \).
   - Choose a private key `x` such that \( 0 < x < q \).
   - Compute the public key `y` as \( y = g^x \mod p \).

2. **Signing Process:**
   - Select a random integer `k` such that \( 0 < k < q \).
   - Compute \( r = (g^k \mod p) \mod q \).
   - Compute \( s = (k^{-1} (H(m) + xr)) \mod q \), where `H(m)` is the hash of the message.
   - The signature is the pair `(r, s)`.

3. **Verification Process:**
   - Compute \( w = s^{-1} \mod q \).
   - Compute \( u1 = (H(m) \cdot w) \mod q \) and \( u2 = (r \cdot w) \mod q \).
   - Compute \( v = ((g^{u1} \cdot y^{u2}) \mod p) \mod q \).
   - The signature is valid if \( v = r \).

**c) Discuss the role of hashing in Blockchain. [5 Marks]**

**Role of Hashing in Blockchain:**

1. **Data Integrity:** Hash functions ensure the integrity of data stored on the blockchain. Any change in the data will produce a different hash, making tampering easily detectable.
2. **Block Hashing:** Each block in the blockchain has a unique hash, which serves as a digital fingerprint of the block's contents. This hash is included in the next block, forming a chain.
3. **Transaction Verification:** Hashing is used to verify transactions. Each transaction is hashed, and these hashes are then combined in a Merkle tree, allowing for efficient and secure verification.
4. **Proof of Work:** In Bitcoin, the proof-of-work algorithm requires miners to find a nonce such that the hash of the block is below a certain target, ensuring that block creation is computationally expensive and resource-intensive.
5. **Security and Privacy:** Hash functions provide an additional layer of security and privacy, making it difficult to reverse-engineer original data or modify transaction details.

**Limitations of Centralized Systems:**

1. **Single Point of Failure:** A centralized server or database is vulnerable to attacks and outages, leading to potential data loss or service disruption.
2. **Lack of Transparency:** Centralized systems often lack transparency, as data is controlled by a single entity. This can lead to mistrust and a lack of accountability.
3. **Scalability Issues:** Centralized systems can become bottlenecks when scaling, as all data processing is handled by a central server.
4. **Data Manipulation and Censorship:** Centralized entities have the power to manipulate data and censor content, posing risks to data integrity and freedom of information.
